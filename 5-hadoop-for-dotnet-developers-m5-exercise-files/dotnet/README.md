## Hadoop for .NET Developers - Module 5

### .NET Framework HBase Client 

Example app which connects to HBase using the Thrift server.

This sample has two projects:

* Sixeyed.HadoopDotNet.Thrift.HBase - generic HBase client from generated Thrift code
* Sixeyed.HadoopDotNet.Thrift.ConsoleApp - app which connects to HBase and queries postcodes

Before running the app, you will need to have HBase services and the Thrift server running.
