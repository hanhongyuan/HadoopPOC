## Hadoop for .NET Developers - Module 5

In this module we look at some of the technologies in the wider Hadoop Ecosystem. We cover:

* Hive - querying HDFS data with HiveQL and integratign .NET Core code
* HBase - creating tables and loading them from HDFS data with Hive
* HBase Thrift server - connecting to HBase from .NET
* Spark - using Python in a Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis

The demo code is all in the `scripts` folder, and the .NET code is in `dotnet` and `dotnetcore`.
