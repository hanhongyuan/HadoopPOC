## Hadoop for .NET Developers - Module 4

### Enhanced Hadoop MapReduce jobs

Scripts used to demonstrate additional Hadoop functionality. To run as-is, you will need a Hadoop installation running version 2.7.2 and .NET Core installed on the worker node(s). For other versions of Hadoop, you will need to mofidy the path to the streaming JAR file.


### File locations

The scripts expect the published .NET Core apps (in the `dotnetcvore` source folder) to be available at `c:\dotnetcore`, and the reference data file (in the source `refdata` folder) in `c:\refdata`.
