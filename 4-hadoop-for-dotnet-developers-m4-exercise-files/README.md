## Hadoop for .NET Developers - Module 4

In this module we look at using more advanced MapReduce functionality in .NET streaming jobs, to improve performance and traceability. We look at using:

* the distributed cache
* combiners
* multiple reducers
* job counters

The code is in the `dotnetcore` folder, and the Hadoop job scripts are in the `hadoop` folder. Each folder has a README explaining how to build and run the code.
